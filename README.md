Mission Statement: 
The ChronArchive is designed to be a living, bi-directional time capsule. It will serve as a portal between the hardware and internet of today, yesterday, and tomorrow. 

This will be realized with a few key objectives, subject to change. 

• It should have a file repository for useful tools, games, applications, and other materials that can be accessed from older machines without hassle
• It should contain a proxy server for as many utilites as possible to allow older machines to function better outside the main website
• It should have online accounts with free utilities good enough to be practical, and paid utilities only when needed to maintain the hardware costs
• It should feature the best security possible while maintaining complete interoperability, so almost everything needs to be server side hardened and client invisible
• It should be fast to load, easy to cache, and throttled only to the extent needed to prevent malicious access
